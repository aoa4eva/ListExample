# ListExample
This is a (very) barebones example of creating a form that saves to a database and then a list that reads from the database
using an iterable object in Thymeleaf. 

To use this project:

- Create a database called secbones
- Open the project with your IDE of choice
- Run the project as a Spring Boot application
